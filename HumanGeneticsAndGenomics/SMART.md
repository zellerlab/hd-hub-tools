# SMART
SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) is a web resource providing simple identification and extensive annotation of protein domains via sequence homology searches. It contains manually curated models for more than 1,200 protein domains. In its ‘Genomic’ mode, it annotates proteins from completely sequenced genomes of 2,031 species as a basis for their functional annotation. It provides flexible tools to visually explore protein domain architectures across sequences and organisms.
