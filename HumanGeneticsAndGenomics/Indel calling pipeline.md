# Indel calling pipeline
The indel pipeline detects high confidence indels (1-20 bp). The results are presented in an extensively annotated VCF file. The input of the pipeline are the aligned tumor and control bam files. To enable a fast quality assessment of functionally indels screen shots are taken of exotic high confidence indels.
