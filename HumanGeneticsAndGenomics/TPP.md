# TPP
Detecting the binding partners of a drug is one of the biggest challenges in drug research. Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) addresses this question by combining the cellular thermal shift assay concept with mass spectrometry based proteome-wide protein quantitation.  The analysis of such  experiments requires several data analytic and statistical modeling steps.   The package TPP facilitates this process by providing executable workflows that conduct all necessary steps to perform an analysis.
