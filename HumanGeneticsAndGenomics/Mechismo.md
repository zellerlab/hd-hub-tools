# Mechismo
Mechismo is a tool that allows rapid predictions of how genetic variants impact on biomolecular function. This is done by a pre-computed collection of protein-protein, protein-DNA/RNA, protein-chemical interactions of known three-dimensional structure mapped to proteomes from major model organisms. Users can input any number of variants to get a ranked list of genes and specific positions that have a functional impact on biomolecular interactions.</span>
