# STRING
STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) is a database of known and predicted protein interactions in the form of direct physical or indirect functional associations, which currently cover 9,643,763 proteins from 2,031 organisms. Interaction data are derived from high-throughput experiments, genomic context, (conserved) coexpression, and the scientific literature. STRING quantitatively integrates interaction data from these sources and transfers information between organisms where applicable.
