# IONiseR
IONiseR provides tools for the quality assessment of Oxford Nanopore MinION data. It extracts summary statistics from a set of fast5 files and can be used either before or after base calling. In addition to standard summaries of the read-types produced, it provides a number of plots for visualising metrics relative to experiment run time or spatially over the surface of a flowcell.
