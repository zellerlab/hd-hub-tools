# RNA-seq end-to-end workflow
End-to-end gene-level RNA-Seq differential expression workflow using Bioconductor packages. Starting from the FASTQ files, these are aligned to the reference genome, and a count matrix which tallies the number of RNA-seq reads/fragments within each gene for each sample is prepared. Performance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) for quality assessment and exploration of the relationship between samples, performance of differential gene expression analysis, and visual exploration of the results.
