# Phenotype Databases for Functional Genomics
These slides describe in detail two databases, GenomeRNAi and GenomeCRISPR, for phenotypes discovered in functional high‚Äêthroughput screens. The slides guide through the user interfaces of both database websites highlighting their functionality in the context of specific biological queries. They discuss the processes of both data curation and integration with external resources. Finally the identification of genetic interactions in cancer cells serves as an example of how database context can be mined to generate new biological findings.
