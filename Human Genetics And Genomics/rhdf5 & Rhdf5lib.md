# rhdf5 & Rhdf5lib
The rhdf5 and Rhdf5lib packages combine to provide an interface between HDF5 and R. The HDF5 file format provides the ability to store and access very large and/or complex datasets and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage (disk) in a completely portable manner. The rhdf5 package is thus suited for the exchange of large and/or complex datasets between R and other software package, and for letting R applications work on datasets that are larger than the available RAM.
In particular HDF5 is being used to address the rapid growth in the size of single-cell datasets, and rhdf5 is a cornerstone to many existing analysis tools.
