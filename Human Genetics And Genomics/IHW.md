# IHW
Independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) is a multiple testing procedure that increases power compared to commonly used alternatives for false discovery rate (FDR) control by assigning data-driven weights to each hypothesis.  The IHW software package provide a mechanism that allows the methodology to be applied to many different data types.
