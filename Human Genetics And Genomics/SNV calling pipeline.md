# SNV calling pipeline
The SNV pipeline creates a set of high confidence somatic SNVs. The pipeline takes a tumor and matched control bam file as input and returns a highly annotated VCF file. In addition the workflow produces plots that help to interpret both, the sample quality (e.g. if the sample is contaminated) as well as biology (e.g. if the sample shows kataegis).
