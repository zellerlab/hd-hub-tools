# BiocWorkflowTools
The bioconductor authoring tool links the journal’s manuscript management system with the Bioconductor nightly build system, thus enabling “continuous Integration”, automated quality control and guaranteed workflow functionality even as underlying resources and tools evolve. A package and tutorial publication are underway, and we have actively helped several authors from the community with workflow authoring.
