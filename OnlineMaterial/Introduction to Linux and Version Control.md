# Introduction to Linux and Version Control
Linux is an operating system with a powerful command line interface that is widely used for biological data analysis and in server and cluster systems. A knowledge and understanding of how to interact effectively with the command line is essential when using many popular bioinformatics software packages, efficiently performing repetitive computational tasks, and working in high-performance computing cluster environments.
This course aims to teach basic commands and shell scripting to the life-scientists who wish to carry out repeated tasks to deal with biological data.
