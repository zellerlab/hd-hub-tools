# F1000Research Channel for Bioconductor
The F1000Research Channel for R/Bioconductor-based workflows was established with support from HD-HuB personnel. These workflows are peer-reviewed academic articles, which increases quality and offers an additional incentive for their authors. The channel is well accepted by the international bioinformatics community.
