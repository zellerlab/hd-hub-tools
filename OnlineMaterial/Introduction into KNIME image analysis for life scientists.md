# Introduction into KNIME image analysis for life scientists
This course material intends to provide a basic introduction into the KNIME (image) data analytics functionalities and the concept of integrative data analysis. Apart from the powerful tools inherited by KNIME itself, one of the basic ideas behind KNIME is to integrate established and commonly used software (like the ImageJ framework for image processing), thus enabling to make use of the power of the KNIME data analytics after having processed the original input raw data (like bioimage raw data in case of image processing).
