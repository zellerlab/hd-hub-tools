# Workflow Management with CWL Bring Your Own Workflow
These slides theoretically explain how to make your data analysis workflows more portable and interoperable with the Common Workflow Language (CWL*)

* “CWL is a specification for describing analysis workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software and hardware environments, from workstations to cluster, cloud, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. CWL is designed to meet the needs of data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Astronomy, Physics, and Chemistry. CWL is developed by an informal, multi-vendor working group consisting of organizations and individuals aiming to enable scientists to share data analysis workflows. The CWL project is on Github and we follow the Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development.”<br/>
