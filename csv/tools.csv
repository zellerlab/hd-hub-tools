GenomeCRISPR`GenomeCRISPR is a database for high-throughput screening experiments performed by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A dynamic web interface guides users through the process of finding information about published CRISPR screens. The database holds detailed data about observed hits and phenotypes. Moreover, it provides knowledge about performance of individual single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) used under various experimental conditions.$
