Dr. Georg Zeller`Georg Zeller studied Bioinformatics, Computer Science and Molecular Biology in Tübingen and Uppsala. He joined the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology and the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory in Tübingen for his PhD studies on machine-learning based analysis of genomics and transcriptomics data. He moved to EMBL to work as a postdoctoral fellow in Peer Bork's group analyzing chemogenomics and metagenomics data. In 2015 he became EMBL Team Leader with responsibilities for bioinformatics support through the Bio-IT project and contributing to the establishment of (inter-)national bioinformatics service platforms, the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) and ELIXIR. He heavily uses R, Python and Bash for biological data analysis and bioinformatics tool development on a daily basis.@

Mike Smith`Mike's previous work at the CRUK Cambridge Institute focused on understanding the properties of the raw data produced by microarrays and next-generation sequencing. Identifying and interpreting instances where errors can occur in with these technologies is an important step in ensuring correct biological conclusions can be drawn from an experiment.<br><br>Mike is involved in a number of software projects, primarily rooted in the R programming language. These include the beadarray, BeadDataPackR and illuminaio packages for dealing with various aspects of Illumina BeadArray processing. He has also contributed code to the snapCGH package for predicting DNA copy-number and break-points from arrayCGH data, and EBImage which provides general purpose image processing tools in the R environment. More recently he has worked on the IONiseR package, for performing quality assessment on Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing data.@
