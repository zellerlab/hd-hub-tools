# BiQAnalyzer HT
__BiQAnalyzer HT__ is the major upgrade of the popular [BiQAnalyzer](http://biq-analyzer.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de) tool specifically designed to aid the analysis of high-throughput bisulfite amplicon sequencing data. BiQAnalyzer HT currently allows to process an amount of bisulfite sequencing reads obtained in one or several bisulfite sequencing experiments.
